        <p>I am a Photography hobbyist and proud owner of two ridiculously adorable cats.</p>
        <p>My husband and I recently moved to the city from the east bay and 2 years prior to that, from Germany.</p>
        <p>After living 10 years in Germany and co-operating our salon we decided to make the journey back to San Francisco.</p>
        <p>I am a licensed hair stylist, but found my passion in web development, which explains this assignment.</p>
        <p>I am an avid reader who enjoys all kinds of genre's, from horror to romance, politics to comedy, I've got a tast for it all</p>
